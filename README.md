# iXAML

[UIAppearance](http://nshipster.com/uiappearance/) allows the appearance of views and controls to be consistently defined across the entire application.

**If UIAppearance is so great, why do we need iXAML?**

A major shortcoming of UIAppearance is that styles are imperative (applied it runtime in code), not declarative.

iXAML adds support for declarative stylesheets

## Design goals of iXAML

* Interface Builder support
* Switching themes at runtime
* Support multiple stylesheet formats (plist, xaml, css, less, etc.)
* Be light-weight and non-intrusive
* No overriding of framework methods
* No swizzling
* No custom base UIView or UIViewController
